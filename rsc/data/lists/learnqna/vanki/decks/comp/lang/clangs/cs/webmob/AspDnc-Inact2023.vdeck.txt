te: business-logic {{{

Could you give me an idea of what business logic means in the context of programming?

Absolutely! Business logic in programming refers to the core rules and operations that define how a particular application or system functions to meet its specific business requirements. Think of it as the "why" and "how" behind the data and user interface. It's the part of the code that translates real-world business processes into software.

Here's a breakdown of what that means:

    Core Functionality: Business logic encompasses the essential tasks and procedures that the software needs to perform to achieve its goals. For an e-commerce site, this might include calculating prices, processing orders, managing inventory, applying discounts, and handling shipping rules.
    Rules and Constraints: It embodies the specific rules, policies, and constraints that govern the business. For example, "a customer can only place an order if their shipping address is within our service area," or "discount codes are only valid for certain products and during a specific timeframe."
    Data Manipulation: Business logic often involves manipulating and transforming data based on these rules. This could involve validating user input, calculating totals, formatting reports, or updating database records in specific ways.
    Separation of Concerns: Ideally, business logic is kept separate from the user interface (how the user interacts with the system) and the data access layer (how the system stores and retrieves data). This separation makes the code more organized, maintainable, and easier to update. If the business rules change, you only need to modify the business logic layer, without affecting the UI or database directly.

Think of it this way:

Imagine you're building software for a library.

    User Interface: The screens and buttons that librarians and patrons use to search for books, check them out, and return them.
    Data Access Layer: The part of the software that interacts with the library's database to store information about books, members, and loans.
    Business Logic: The rules that govern how these interactions happen. This could include:
        Calculating late fees based on the due date and the type of book.
        Checking if a member has exceeded their borrowing limit.
        Sending overdue notices.
        Determining if a book is available for loan.

In essence, business logic is the "brain" of your application. It's where the real work happens and where the application's unique value lies. It's what makes your software do what it's supposed to do for the business it serves.

Does that give you a clearer picture? Let me know if you'd like to explore any specific aspect of business logic further!

te: domain-logic {{{

I think so. Very helpful. What about the next 'buzz-term' I came across here, i.e. 'domain logic'?

That's a great follow-up! The term "domain logic" is very closely related to "business logic," and in many contexts, they are used interchangeably. However, there can be a subtle distinction, especially within the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

Here's how to understand domain logic:

Domain: In software development, the "domain" refers to the specific subject area or the real-world activity that the software is designed to support. For a library application, the domain is library operations (borrowing, lending, cataloging, etc.). For an e-commerce site, the domain is online sales (products, orders, customers, payments, etc.).

Domain Logic: Domain logic is the part of the software that represents the core rules, concepts, and knowledge of that specific domain. It focuses on what the domain is and how things work within it, independent of any specific application or technology.

The Relationship with Business Logic:

    Often Synonymous: In many practical scenarios, especially for business applications, the domain is the business. Therefore, the domain logic effectively is the business logic. The rules and operations within the "library domain" are the business rules of the library. The rules and operations within the "online sales domain" are the business rules of the e-commerce business.
    Focus on the "What": Domain logic tends to be more focused on the fundamental entities, their attributes, their relationships, and the core processes within the domain itself. It's about modeling the reality of the domain in software.
    Abstraction: Domain logic often aims for a higher level of abstraction, trying to capture the essence of the domain in a way that is less tied to specific use cases or technical implementations.

Think of it this way:

Imagine our library software again:

    Domain: The world of libraries, books, members, loans, etc.
    Domain Logic:
        A Book has properties like Title, Author, ISBN.
        A Member has properties like MemberID, Name, Address.
        The concept of a Loan which links a Member to a Book with a DueDate.
        Rules about how many books a member can borrow.
        The process of checking out a book (creating a Loan).
        The process of returning a book (updating the Loan status).

Now, let's consider business logic in this context:

    It would include the domain logic (the core rules of library operations).
    It might also include specific business requirements like:
        Calculating late fees (a business policy based on the loan duration).
        Sending email reminders for overdue books (a specific business process).
        Generating reports on popular books (a business intelligence need).

Key Takeaway:

While the terms are often used interchangeably, you can think of domain logic as the more fundamental representation of the core concepts and processes within a specific area of knowledge (the domain). Business logic then builds upon this domain logic and incorporates the specific rules, policies, and workflows of a particular business operating within that domain.

In many cases, especially when building software directly for a business, the domain you're modeling is the business, making domain logic and business logic essentially the same thing. However, understanding the slight nuance can be helpful, especially when discussing architectural patterns like Domain-Driven Design, where the focus is on creating a rich and accurate model of the domain itself.

Does that distinction make sense?

WebApplicationBuilder configures a lot of things by default, including ____ (!!)
{{{
    - Configuration - Your app loads
      values from JSON-files and
      environment-variables that you
      can use to control the app's
      runtime-behavior, such as loading
      connection-strings for a

      those used by the framework and
      those specific to your
      application - must be registered
      so that they can be instantiated
      correctly at runtime. The
      WebApplicationBuilder configures
      the minimal set of services
      needed for an ASP.NET Core app.
      Chapters 8 and 9 look at

After configuring the WebApplicationBuilder you call Build() to create a WebApplication-instance. The WebApplication-instance is where you define how your application handles and responds to requests, using two building-blocks:
{{{
    - Middleware - These small
      components execute in sequence
      when the application receives an
      HTTP-request. They can perform a
      whole host of functions, such as
      logging, identifying the current
      user for a request, serving
      static files, and handling
      errors. We'll look in detail at
      the middleware-pipeline in
      chapter 4.
    - Endpoints - Endpoints

Every HTTP-request includes a verb that ____

    indicates the type of the
    request. When you're browsing a
    website, the default verb is GET,
    which fetches a resource from the
    server so you can view it. The
    second-most-common verb is POST,
    which is used to send data to the
    server, such as when you're

Typically, you'll ____ (=how to create the services for an app(!!))  **!
{{{
    Typically, you'll register the
    dependencies of your application
    into a container, which you can use
    to create any service.
    You can use the container to create both
    your own custom application-services and
    the framework-services used by
    ASP.NET Core.
    You must register each service with the
    container before using it in your
    application.
    
    In an ASP.NET Core
    application, this registration is
    performed by using the
    Services-property of
    WebApplicationBuilder.
    Whenever you
    use a new ASP.NET Core feature in
    your application, you need to come
    back to Program.cs and add the
    necessary services. This task isn't
    always as arduous as it sounds,
    typically requiring only a line or
    two of code to configure your
    applications.
    
    In listing 3.4 we configured an
    optional service for the HTTP
    logging middleware by using the
    line
    
    builder.Services.AddHttpLogging(opts =>
      opts.LoggingFields = HttpLoggingFields.RequestProperties);
    
    Calling AddHttpLogging() adds the
    necessary services for the HTTP
    logging middleware to the
    IoC-container and customizes the
    options used by the middleware for
    what to display. AddHttpLogging
    isn't exposed directly on the
    Services property; it's an
    extension-method that provides a
    convenient way to encapsulate all
    the code required to set up
    HTTP-logging. This pattern of
    encapsulating setup behind
    extension methods is common in
    ASP.NET Core.

The addition of middleware to WebApplication to form the pipeline should be familiar to you now, but several points are worth noting in this example  (** **)
{{{
    - Middleware is added with
      Use*()-methods.
    - MapGet defines an endpoint, not
      middleware. It defines the
      endpoints that the routing and
      endpoint middleware can use.
    - WebApplication automatically adds
      some middleware to the pipeline,
      such as the EndpointMiddleware.
    - The order of the Use*()-method
      calls is important and defines
      the order of the middleware
      pipeline.

    Figure 4.18 shows what happens when

The sequence of events when an unhandled exception occurs somewhere in the middleware-pipeline (or in an endpoint) after ExceptionHandlerMiddleware is as follows:
{{{
    - 1. A piece of middleware throws
      an exception.
    - 2. ExceptionHandlerMiddleware
      catches the exception.
    - 3. Any partial response that has
      been defined is cleared.
    - 4. The ExceptionHandlerMiddleware
      overwrites the request path with
      the provided error-handling path.
    - 5. The middleware sends the
      request back down the pipeline,
      as though the original request
      had been for the error-handling
      path.
    - 6. The middleware pipeline
      generates a new response as
      normal.
    - 7. When the response gets back to
      ExceptionHandlerMiddleware, it
      modifies the status code to a

      the web-server.

    file to a client. In that case,
    ASP.NET Core may start streaming

    something to be aware of.
    --
    aspdnc_inact2023-p81_115..
    }}}
A more common problem occurs when the error-handling path throws an error during the reexecution of the pipeline. NN@Imagine that there's a bug in the code that generates the menu at the top of the page in a Razor Pages app:
{{{
    - 1. When the user reaches your
      home page, the code for
      generating the menu bar throws an
      exception.
    - 2. The exception propagates up
      the middleware pipeline.
    - 3. When reached,
      ExceptionHandlerMiddleware
      captures it, and the pipe is
      reexecuted, using the
      error-handling path.
    - 4. When the error page executes,
      it attempts to generate the menu
      bar for your app, which again
      throws an exception.
    - 5. The exception propagates up
      the middleware-pipeline.
    - 6. ExceptionHandlerMiddleware has
      already tried to intercept a
      request, so it lets the error
      propagate all the way to the top
      of the middleware-pipeline.
    - 7. The web server returns a raw
      500 error, as though there were
      no error-handling middleware at
      all.

    - Middleware can run for all
      requests; filters will run only
      for requests that reach the
      EndpointMiddleware and execute
      the associated endpoint.
    - Filters have access to additional
      details about the endpoint that
      will execute, such as the return
      value of the endpoint, for
      example an IResult. Middleware in
      general won't see these
      intermediate steps, so it sees
      only the generated response.
    - Filters can easily be restricted
      to a subset of requests, such as
      a single endpoint or a group of
      endpoints. Middleware generally
      applies to all requests (though

{{{
    That's all well and good, but how
    should we interpret these
    differences? When should we choose
    one over the other?
    
    I like to think of middleware
    versus filters as a question of
    specificity. NN@Middleware is the
    more general concept, operating on
    lower-level primitives such as
    HttpContext, so it has wider reach.
    N@If the functionality you need has
    no endpoint-specific requirements,
    you should use a middleware
    component. NN@NN@Exception handling
    is a great example; exceptions
    could happen anywhere in your
    application, and you need to handle
    them, so using exception-handling
    middleware makes sense.
    
    NN@On the other hand, if you do
    need access to endpoint details, or
    if you want to behave differently
    for some requests, you should
    consider using a filter. Validation
    is a good example. Not all requests
    need the same validation. Requests
    for static files, for example,
    don't need parameter validation,
    the way requests to an API endpoint
    do. Applying validation to the
    endpoints via filters makes sense
    in this case.
    
      Tip: Where possible, consider
      using middleware for
      cross-cutting concerns. Use
      filters when you need different
      behavior for different endpoints
      or where the functionality relies
      on endpoint concepts such as
      IResult objects.

Routing + 'the SEO-advantage'  ****
{{{
    NNNN@NN@The difference is that with
    routing, you can completely
    customize the URLs, as shown in
    figure 6.2. This feature gives you
    much more flexibility and can be
    important in real-life applications
    for search engine optimization
    (SEO).
    
      Note: With the flexibility of
      routing, you can encode the

    NN@NN@Endpoint routing is
    fundamental to all but the simplest
    ASP.NET Core apps. It's implemented
    with two pieces of middleware,
    which you've already seen:
    
    - EndpointRoutingMiddleware - This
      middleware chooses which
      registered endpoints execute for
      a given request at runtime. To
      make it easier to distinguish
      between the two types of
      middleware, I'll be referring to
      this middleware as the
      RoutingMiddleware throughout this
      book.
    - EndpointMiddleware - This
      middleware is typically placed at
      the end of your middleware
      pipeline. The middleware executes
      the endpoint selected by the
      RoutingMiddleware at runtime.

    You register the endpoints in your
    application by calling Map*
    functions on an
    IEndpointRouteBuilder instance. In
    .NET 7 apps, this instance
    typically is a WebApplication
    instance but doesn't have to be, as
